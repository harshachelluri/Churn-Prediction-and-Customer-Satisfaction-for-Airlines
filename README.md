[dataset](https://github.com/harshachelluri/Churn-Prediction-and-Customer-Satisfaction-for-Airlines/blob/main/airline-customer-data%20Datsets.csv)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn at ShyWay Airlines, addressing the challenges of customer dissatisfaction and churn. By analyzing various customer behaviors, service feedback, flight details, and revenue contributions, the goal is to identify customers at high risk of leaving and implement targeted strategies to enhance customer loyalty, satisfaction, and revenue.

## Project Objectives

1. **Churn Prediction**:  
   Develop a predictive model that forecasts customer churn based on customer behavior, service satisfaction ratings, and flight-related factors.

2. **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**:  
   Analyze factors affecting customer satisfaction, including service ratings, flight experience, and loyalty tier. This will provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

3. **Actionable Insights**:  
   Generate actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer experience, such as personalized retention strategies and service improvements.

4. **Revenue Optimization**:  
   By predicting and reducing churn, the project aims to help ShyWay Airlines retain valuable customers and optimize long-term revenue.

5. **Improved Business Strategy**:  
   The insights gained will support better decision-making in resource allocation, targeting high-value customers for retention efforts.

## Data Overview

The dataset includes detailed customer and flight information, such as demographics, booking behavior, service ratings, and revenue contributions. The key features include:

### Customer Details
- **Customer_ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Age**, **Gender**, **Location**: Customer demographics.
- **Flight Details**: Flight ID, Booking Channel, Flight Cancellations.
- **Loyalty Tier**, **Booking Frequency**, **Miles Accrued**: Customer loyalty and flight behavior.

### Revenue Details
- **Price_of_Ticket**: Total cost of the flight ticket.
- **Revenue_Contribution**: Total revenue generated by the customer.
- **Ancillary_Purchases**, **Discount_Usage**: Additional purchases and discount usage.

### Service Details
- **Service Ratings**: Ratings for services like inflight Wi-Fi, seat comfort, food and drink, etc.
- **Complaints Frequency**, **NPS**: Customer feedback on services and likelihood of recommending the airline.
- **Flight Delays**: Departure and arrival delays.
- **Booking Behavior**: Recency of last flight and average interval time between flights.

## **Methodology**

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing/standardizing numerical features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Deriving additional features (e.g., frequency of complaints, average interval time) to improve model performance.
3. **Model Development**: Using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict customer churn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
5. **Insights Generation**: Analyzing the model's output to generate insights into customer behavior and satisfaction.

## **Tools and Libraries**

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:

- **Python** for data processing, modeling, and analysis
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for project documentation and execution

## Conclusion

By leveraging data science to predict and address customer churn, ShyWay Airlines can improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and optimize revenue. This project provides actionable insights that will guide the airline in enhancing its services and building stronger customer loyalty in a competitive market.
